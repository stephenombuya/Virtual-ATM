# Virtual ATM - Microservices Architecture üè¶

## Overview
The Virtual ATM system is designed using a microservices architecture, allowing modular, scalable, and independent services for better performance and maintainability.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è
The system consists of four main microservices:
1. **Account Service** - Manages user accounts, authentication, and balance.
2. **Transaction Service** - Handles deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history.
3. **Notification Service** - Provides real-time status updates.
4. **Frontend** - A GTK-based UI that interacts with the services through REST APIs.

Each service runs independently and communicates via HTTP requests.

## Installation & Setup üöÄ
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/stephenombuya/Virtual-ATM/tree/main/src/Microservices%20Application
cd virtual-atm
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run with Docker Compose
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed, then run:
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```
This will start all microservices.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Services
- **Account Service:** `http://localhost:5001`
- **Transaction Service:** `http://localhost:5002`
- **Notification Service:** `http://localhost:5003`
- **Frontend (GTK App):** Run `python3 frontend/app.py`
