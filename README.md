# Virtual ATM - Complete Documentation üè¶

## Overview
The **Virtual ATM** is a software-based ATM system that allows users to manage their bank accounts, perform transactions, and receive notifications. It has been implemented in two different architectures:
1. **Monolithic Architecture** üèóÔ∏è
2. **Microservices Architecture** üåê

Both implementations provide a functional ATM experience with features like authentication, balance inquiries, deposits, withdrawals, transaction history, and notifications.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Monolithic Version
### Features:
- Single application handling all functionalities.
- Integrated SQLite database for accounts and transactions.
- GTK-based graphical user interface.
- Status bar notifications for login, transactions, and errors.
- CSV export for transaction history.

### Tech Stack:
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Frontend:** GTK (GObject)
- **Database:** SQLite

### Setup Instructions:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/stephenombuya/Virtual-ATM
cd virtual-atm/monolithic
make
./virtual_atm
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Microservices Version
### Features:
- Modular design with independent services:
  - **Account Service** (User authentication & balance management)
  - **Transaction Service** (Deposits, withdrawals, history management)
  - **Notification Service** (Real-time status updates)
  - **Frontend** (GTK-based UI communicating via APIs)
- REST API communication between services.
- Dockerized deployment.

### Tech Stack:
- **Backend:** Python (Flask, SQLite)
- **Frontend:** GTK (PyGObject)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose

### Setup Instructions:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-atm.git
cd virtual-atm
docker-compose up --build
```

## Comparison: Monolithic vs Microservices ‚öñÔ∏è
| Feature | Monolithic | Microservices |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| **Scalability** | Limited | High |
| **Maintainability** | Harder | Easier |
| **Performance** | Slower under load | Faster, optimized services |
| **Deployment** | Simple | Requires containerization |
| **Fault Isolation** | Low | High |
